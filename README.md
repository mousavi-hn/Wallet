There are several features implemented, right after starting the program you face usual sign-in/sign-up options, you can create a new account and enter your private space with a password!<br/><br/>
There you can add records, and in case needed, you can delete some of them also. Some time later you can check the records by searching for relevant ones, for example how much I spent for food last month is an important question which here you can answer it by an easy query!<br/><br/>
Some other features like changing password is also available!<br/><br/>
If you are passing by I would appreciate it a lot if you please leave a comment and give me your opinion! Anyway, if you are not interested, no problem at all!<br/><br/> Thank you for just passing by and wish to see you around again!
