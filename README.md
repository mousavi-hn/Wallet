There are several features implemented, right after starting the program you face usual sign-in/sign-up options, you can create a new account and enter your private space with a password! 
There you can add records, in case needed you can delete some of them and some time you can check them by searching for relevant records, for example how much I spent for food last month is an important question which here you can answer it by an easy query! 
If you are passing by I would appreciate it a lot leaving a comment giving me your opinion! Thank you!
